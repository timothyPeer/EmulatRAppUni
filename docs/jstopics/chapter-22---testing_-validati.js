hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">This chapter defines the verification strategy for ASA-EmulatR. It explains how correctness is tested, how regressions are prevented, and how architectural compliance with Alpha AXP is asserted and defended. This is the capstone chapter — it is not about features but about credibility.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Core Principle:<\/span> Architectural claims must be provable, not aspirational. If behavior cannot be tested, it is not considered correct. ASA-EmulatR treats testing and validation as first-class architectural concerns, not post-hoc activities.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scope:<\/span> This chapter covers the definition of correctness, the five-layer validation strategy (unit → instruction → pipeline → SMP → system), determinism as a validation instrument, subsystem-specific validation (exceptions, memory ordering, LL\/SC, PAL, devices), regression testing policy, the architectural compliance matrix, known deviations and non-goals, and the final compliance statement. It does not cover the tracing infrastructure (Chapter 21) except where tracing supports validation.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This chapter should be treated as a correctness checklist, a validation guide, a regression test oracle, and a contributor contract.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">See Also: <a href=\"chapter_21___debugging__tracin8a9b0c1d.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Chapter 21 – Debugging, Tracing, and Determinism<\/a> (tracing infrastructure supporting validation); <a href=\"chapter_11___architectural_invabec0da0.html\" class=\"topiclink\">Chapter 11 – Architectural Invariants<\/a> (invariant definitions that validation must verify).<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
