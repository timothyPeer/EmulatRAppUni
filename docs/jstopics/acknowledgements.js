hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">ASA-EMulatR builds on decades of work by the engineers who designed, documented, and preserved the Alpha AXP architecture. This project would not exist without their contributions.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Alpha AXP Architecture<\/strong><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The Alpha architecture was designed at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) by Richard L. Sites, Richard T. Witek, and the Alpha development team. The architectural reference manuals, hardware reference manuals, and PALcode specifications produced by DEC (and later Compaq and Hewlett-Packard) remain the authoritative sources for Alpha AXP behavior and are the foundation of this emulator\'s correctness claims.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Run Loop and Pipeline Architecture<\/strong><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The per-cycle run loop and six-stage pipeline model draw from the publicly documented EV6 (21264) microarchitecture. The design of the deterministic execution model — one cycle per iteration, deterministic stage ordering, no speculative side effects — was informed by the cycle-accurate simulation techniques described in the Alpha EV6 hardware reference manual and related microarchitectural publications.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Documentation<\/strong><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This system reference guide and all contemporaneous development notes were authored and maintained in Help &amp; Manual (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpandmanual.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">https:\/\/www.helpandmanual.com<\/a>) by EC Software. Help &amp; Manual provided the authoring environment for the full documentation set — 22 chapters, 9 appendices, and the working notes that guided architectural decisions throughout the project. The HTML Help and WebHelp outputs are compiled directly from the Help &amp; Manual project.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Open Source Community<\/strong><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The emulator uses the Qt framework (The Qt Company) for its application infrastructure, GUI components, and cross-platform support. CMake (Kitware) provides the build system. The project benefits from the broader open-source emulation community whose published work on instruction-accurate and cycle-approximate emulation informed architectural decisions throughout development.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Development Tools<\/strong><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Portions of the code, and documentation were developed with the assistance of AI-assisted development tools. All AI-generated content has been reviewed, verified against architectural specifications, and integrated under the terms of this project\'s license.<\/p>\n\r"
