The process: device completes work, device asserts interrupt line (via IRQPendingState), CPU samples interrupt during pre-cycle phase (via AlphaCPU::checkInterrupts()), interrupt is delivered through PAL (via PalService::deliverInterrupt()).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Each device has an assigned IRQ vector (from IrqTemplate) and IPL (typically IPL 20 for devices). Trigger mode is configurable: edge-triggered (one-shot) or level-triggered (held until acknowledged). IRQPendingState handles both modes via its inServiceMask for level-triggered sources.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<h2 class=\"p_Heading2\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_Heading2\">10.9.2 Interrupt Acknowledgment<\/span><\/h2>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Interrupt acknowledgment typically occurs via MMIO: CPU reads or writes a device register (e.g., ISR clear-on-read, interrupt acknowledge register write), device clears the interrupt condition, and the interrupt line is deasserted. PAL code often performs this acknowledgment as part of the interrupt handler.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">See Also: <a href=\"chapter-7_9-interrupt-handling.html\" class=\"topiclink\">7.10 Interrupt Handling<\/a>; coreLib\/IRQPendingState.h.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
