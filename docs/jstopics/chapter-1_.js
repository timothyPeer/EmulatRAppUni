The emulator targets the EV6 (21264) family of Alpha processors and boots using authentic SRM console firmware images.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The system is structured around a clear separation between architectural specification and implementation. The architecture (DevSpace Chapters 1–11) defines what must be true: the execution model, pipeline contract, memory ordering rules, exception semantics, privilege boundaries, and SMP guarantees. The implementation (DevSpace Chapters 12–22) defines how those rules are enforced in code: the AlphaCPU worker, pipeline mechanics, Box implementations, memory subsystem, device models, fault dispatch, and boot sequence. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This document serves as the organizational front door to the EmulatR project. It provides a navigable hierarchical structure that orients developers and reviewers, then directs them to the appropriate depth within this guide or source code for detailed treatment.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Intended consumers of this document - &nbsp;high-level architecture of EMulatR for emulator developers, maintainers, and reviewers. It explains the major subsystems, their responsibilities, and how they interact during execution.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This chapter is normative. The architectural invariants described here must be preserved by all implementations, refactors, and optimizations.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The goal is not to explain individual instructions or implementation details, but to describe the shape of the system and the contracts between its components.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">DevSpace Reference: Chapters 1–11 (Architecture), Chapters 12–22 (Implementation)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
