hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">EMulatR implements a single shared physical address space, called <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">GuestMemory<\/span>, accessible by all CPUs. There is one unified physical address space with no per-CPU private memory. All CPUs observe the same backing store, and SMP correctness is enforced by coherency rules (barrier coordination and reservation invalidation), not by memory ownership.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">GuestMemory<\/span> instance is created as a process-wide singleton via <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">global_GuestMemory()<\/span> (thread-safe initialization in <span class=\"f_CodeExample\">global_GuestMemory.cpp<\/span>). Every CPU, every DMA path, and every device access routes through this single instance. The class is declared <strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">final<\/strong>, non-copyable, and non-movable.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invariant:<\/strong> GuestMemory is global and authoritative. No subsystem may access physical memory without routing through GuestMemory.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">See Also: memoryLib\/global_GuestMemory.h – Singleton accessor; memoryLib\/GuestMemory.h – Class declaration.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
