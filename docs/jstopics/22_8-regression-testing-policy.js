hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Every validated behavior becomes a regression test. The regression policy is strict and non-negotiable:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tests are never removed.<\/strong> Once a test is added to the regression suite, it remains permanently. Tests may be updated to reflect intentional behavioral changes, but the behavioral expectation they encode is never silently discarded.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Failures block integration.<\/strong> A regression failure is a hard stop. No code change that introduces a regression may be integrated until the regression is resolved — either by fixing the regression or by explicitly documenting and justifying the behavioral change.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deterministic replay is required.<\/strong> Regression tests must be reproducible. Tests that rely on non-deterministic scheduling or timing are useful for stress testing but do not qualify as regression tests. All regression tests run under deterministic scheduling mode.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Version-to-version comparison is supported.<\/strong> Deterministic replay enables running the same test sequence against different emulator versions and comparing architectural outcomes. Any divergence between versions is a regression signal.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">This policy prevents architectural drift — the gradual, unintentional divergence of emulator behavior from the architectural specification that occurs when changes are made without comprehensive regression coverage.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SeeAlso\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_SeeAlso\">See Also: <a href=\"21_8-deterministic-replay.html\" class=\"topiclink\">21.8 Deterministic Replay<\/a> (replay mechanism supporting regression tests).<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
